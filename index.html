            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>It's nice to meet you and thanks for being here. My entire life I have always been drawn to the magic of the universe unknown. The feelings and knowings of our energies and of those from beyond. I remember being a small child and sensing presence, seeing images of adults around me that were unexplainable. Feeling people's energy and experiencing the depths of their energy field. As I grew, I attuned to this gift, letting it guide me through my own trials and tribulations. Healing my own heart through intuitive work led me to the realization that our spiritual self serves as a vehicle to a life filled with abundance, security and love within ourselves. It's an honor to connect with people in times of transition, unknowing or curiosity.
            </p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>First and foremost I am a student; constantly learning and evolving; accessing energy and diving deeper into self. Im also a Yogi, Clairvoyant, Reiki practitioner, and lifelong wonderer. An inquisitive and curious soul, I have never shied away from the mystery and deep inquiry of the self. For as long as I can remember, I’ve been able to feel and sense the different energies around me — a gift that has guided my life and work in profound ways.
                Through years of meditation practice, yoga trainings, and personal exploration, I’ve affirmed the deep connection within and embraced my intuitive gifts- I truly believe we all have access to this. It’s been my honor to help others walk the path of self-inquiry, healing, and hope, offering grounding connection as the foundation for true transformation. 
                In addition to exploration with self, I believe food can be a vessel to healing. As a trained natural foods Chef and someone who has struggled with disordered eating my entire life, I think its important to incorporate joy and love in what we eat, while being nutrient dense and filing. I include easy and nourishing meals with my weekly packages to offer ease and enjoyment while you commit to your intentions. I will never promote a diet and truly believe all food is energy. 
                In my work, I blend intuition, meditation, and practical guidance to facilitate connection and authentic communication with the self and energy beyond. I believe exploration with self isn’t about fixing what’s broken — it’s about returning to the truth of who you are, reconnecting with your inner wisdom, and allowing yourself to fully connect with the tethers that connect us all to the universe and all its capacities.
                If you’re ready to explore your inner landscape, whether it be inquiry to a specific question or path or to go deeper and release what no longer serves you, and step into your fullest, most authentic self, I’m here to hold space for your journey- whatever that may mean to you. </p>
